## Market Opportunity
The market for ADHD management solutions is substantial and growing. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of ADHD has been steadily increasing over the years, with more individuals being diagnosed and seeking solutions to manage their symptoms. However, there is still a lack of comprehensive, personalized tools tailored specifically for individuals with ADHD. MyndMap fills this gap by offering a unique combination of AI-driven assistance, task organization, and personalized recommendations. Through market research and user feedback, we continuously refine our offerings to meet the evolving needs of our target audience.

## Features (MVP)
**User Registration and Authentication:** Implement a user registration and login system to allow users to create accounts and securely access the platform.

**Task Creation and Management:** Create the ability for users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Users should be able to set task names, descriptions, priorities, due dates, and statuses.

**AI-driven Task Recommendations:** Develop AI algorithms to provide personalized task recommendations and strategies based on user input and preferences.

**Task Organization:** Enable users to organize tasks based on priority, due date, and other custom categories.

## Frameworks

MyndMap is desired on the following frameworks:

**Frontend - React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture, efficient rendering, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. React's flexibility and performance make it an excellent choice for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces in MyndMap.

**Backend - Flask**: Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a suitable choice for developing the backend of MyndMap. Flask provides the necessary tools for building web applications, handling requests, and interacting with databases.

These are desired, and have not yet been implemented.

## Technology Stack
MyndMap leverages the infrastructure provided by **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for **cloud storage and hosting**. We utilize **Postgres** for **structured data storage**, **Hadoop** for **unstructured data storage and processing**, and **Airflow** for **data transformation and processing**. Our team focuses on continuous improvement, user support, and research efforts to enhance our offerings and ensure a seamless user experience.
