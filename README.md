# MyndMap

MyndMap is a web application designed to help individuals with ADHD improve their focus and productivity. It leverages AI technology to adapt to each user's unique needs and provide personalized assistance. This README provides comprehensive documentation for MyndMap, including its features, installation instructions, how to contribute, and licensing information.

## Features

- **Personalised AI Assistance**: MyndMap uses advanced AI algorithms to adapt to each user's specific needs, providing tailored strategies and recommendations for improving focus and productivity.

- **ADHD Assessment**: The application includes a comprehensive ADHD assessment based on the DSM-5 criteria. Users can complete the assessment to gauge the severity of their struggles and receive personalised recommendations.

- **Task Organization and Reminders**: MyndMap helps users organize their tasks and provides reminders to stay on track. It allows users to set priorities, deadlines, and track their progress.

- **Subscription Plans**: MyndMap offers a free subscription plan. Other plans may be implemented based on user feedback.

## Frameworks

MyndMap is built using the following frameworks:

**Frontend - React**: React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture, efficient rendering, and a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools. React's flexibility and performance make it an excellent choice for creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces in MyndMap.

**Backend - Flask**: Flask is a lightweight and flexible Python web framework. It is known for its simplicity and ease of use, making it a suitable choice for developing the backend of MyndMap. Flask provides the necessary tools for building web applications, handling requests, and interacting with databases.

These are desired, and have not yet been implemented.
